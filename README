						=== wipeX ===
					version beta 0.5


This is a set of web scripts intended to be used for managing the Bukkit Plugin 
	PermissionsEX (https://github.com/t3hk0d3/PermissionsEx).
	
			BE AWARE:
				This is a beta version of wipeX.
				Not all tools function 100% properly.
	
Features:
    * 100% more Ajax!
    * Queued View & Confirm: Set up a list of PEX commands and execute them all at once!
    * Alerts upon errors: Did you screw something up? No matter, wipeX will alert you to the command that failed with a helpful error message!
    * Event Logging: Find out who did what to the permissions database, and undo it!
    * Simple install! Just follow the documented Config section, and move onto your webserver!
    * Tight Security! Four easy to install security modules to keep unwanted wannabe-hackers out of your permissions:
        - No-Security - if you've already password protected the directory!
        - Simple-Security - if you don't need anything fancier!
        - PHPBB-Standalone Security - Only let certain phpbb groups use wipeX.
        - PHPBB-Embedded Security - Same as Standalone, but made to be included in a phpbb page.
